# Kickstarter Campaigns Analysis
## "Fever" is the new theater play by emerging playwright Louise. By analyzing crowdfunding campaigns in theater plays we will give a recommendation so Louise's crowdfunding campaign is a success.  
### We want to convince Louise that with accurate goal and timing there will be no hesitancy on jumping into her first crowfunding campaign.

## Analysis and Challenges

As a big picture we can see that theater is the category that uses more crowdfunding campaigns, it is not a category as successful as music or film & video but it has a rate near 50% for successful campaigns, we can se that analysis in the graph shown below.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

In terms of time, we recommend to make the campaign in the months of May, June and July; following that order for priority, remember that starting early in those months has a greater chance for achieve a successful campaign. I definitely not recommend to launch the campaign in the last two months of the year.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

Since this is the first crowfunding campaign  we recommend to reduce the estimated budget to a maximum of $5,600 and a minimum of $3,100 so there are greater possibilities to have a successful campaign and achieve the goal. If there is hesitancy about jumping into a campaign it is better to have less expectations of the monetary resources obtained via crowfunding, it is recommended to look for other ways for financing the play and not depend only on crowdfunding.

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Theater Outcomes by Launch Date?
  1. It is more possible to have a successful theater campaign than a failed theater campaign.
  2. In December overall theater campaigns fall but there is a greater possibility to have a failed campaign rather than in previous months.

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
  It is 70% possible to have a succesful campaign if the goal is below $5,000. 

- What are some limitations of this dataset?
  A limitation was the original format used for the dates. It will be good to know who is launching the campaign, what type of institution or person is launching it.

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
  It will be good to include an analysis based on campaign duration.
