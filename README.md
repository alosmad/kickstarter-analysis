# Kickstarter Campaigns Analysis
## "Fever" is the new theater play by emerging playwright Louise. By analyzing crowdfunding campaigns in theater plays we will give a recommendation so Louise's crowdfunding campaign is a success.  
### We want to convince Louise that with accurate goal and timing there will be no hesitancy on jumping into her first crowfunding campaign.

## Analysis and Challenges

As a big picture we can see that theater is the category that uses more crowdfunding campaigns, it is not a category as successful as music or film & video but it has a rate near 50% for successful campaigns, we can se that analysis in the graph shown below.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

In terms of time, we recommend to make the campaign in the first 5 months of the year where the success rate increases.

Since this is the first crowfunding campaign  we recommend to reduce the estimated budget to a maximum of $5,600 and a minimum of $3,100 so there are greater possibilities to have a successful campaign and achieve the goal. If there is hesitancy about jumping into a campaign it is better to have less expectations of the monetary resources obtained via crowfunding, it is recommended to look for other ways for financing the play and not depend only on crowdfunding.
